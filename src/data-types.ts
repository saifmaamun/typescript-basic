// built in types


let roll:number = 0;
const firstName:string ='SAIF';
const maritualStatus:boolean = false;

const mentalStatus:undefined= undefined;
// Undefined is the default value for uninitialized variables. which is not defined. 
// Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
// Whenever we declare a variable without initializing it with a value, TypeScript initializes it as undefined . 


const future:null= null;
// The primitive type null indicates the intentional absence of a value. Therefore, in JavaScript, programmers often assign null to a variable to denote that the variable is declared and initialized and currently doesnâ€™t hold a value. Still, a value can be expected in the future.
